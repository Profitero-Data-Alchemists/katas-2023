# Assumptions

1. All agency APIs, including those for airlines, hotels, and car rentals, provide a standardized integration interface. The primary difference among them lies in the specific endpoints used for communication.

2. ue to budget constraints, the project has chosen to integrate with the top three email providers: Gmail, Outlook, and iCloud Mail. These providers have been prioritized for integration efforts.

3. Reservation data can be updated from various sources, including email, agency APIs, and travel systems APIs. This flexibility allows for comprehensive reservation management and real-time updates from multiple channels.
