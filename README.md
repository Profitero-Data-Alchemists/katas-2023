Welcome to the Profitero Data Alchemists Architectural Kata run by O'Reilly in September 2023.
We are the architecture team within Profitero, a midsize product company, which gather, enhance, and deliver ecommerce data to our global customer base. 

Our mission is to design and shape the foundation upon which data flows, insights are born, and solutions are built. 

As architects, we understand the power and potential of data to transform industries, drive efficiencies, and unlock new possibilities. We are at the forefront of organizing, securing, and optimizing data ecosystems to unleash their full potential.
