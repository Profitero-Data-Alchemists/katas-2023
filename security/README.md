# Security

Based on the provided requirements for a project "The Road Warrior", here are the security practices that are applicable:

### Authentication and Authorization
* The requirement for user accounts and user authentication implies the need for strong authentication mechanisms, such as secure password storage, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure user sessions to protect against unauthorized access.
* Implement role-based access control to restrict access to shared reservations.

### Data Encryption (both transit and at rest)
* The use of encryption for data in transit (via TLS/SSL) helps secure data as it travels between the user's device, the application, and backend servers.

### Secure API Integration (how exactly it is secured?)
* The integration with external airline, hotel, and car rental systems requires secure API integration practices to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

### Secure Credentials Management (how we manage our service key's  , database, message broker)
* The requirement for customers to manage their reservations implies the need for secure password management practices, including strong password policies and secure storage.

### Session Management
* Secure session management is crucial to protect user sessions (especially for multiple devices) and prevent session-related attacks, especially when users interact with their reservations and travel information.

### Security Testing (static code analysis and check code for credentials + runtime security scanning)
* Regular security assessments and code reviews are essential to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application.

### Incident Response Plan
* An incident response plan is important to address security incidents promptly and minimize potential damage.

### Employee Training and Awareness

* Security training and awareness are crucial for all team members to prevent security lapses.

### Regular Security Audits (it is necessary to collect access logs for X month for audit purposes)
* Regular security audits help assess the overall security posture of the project and identify vulnerabilities.
